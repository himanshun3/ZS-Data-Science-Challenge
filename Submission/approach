The Steps that were taken to build the model are:

1. Importing data.
2. Droping Merchant_ID from train data.
3. Grouping data by Year,Month,ProductID,Country and Calculating the sum of sales.
4. MAking a list of Unique Countries.
5. Making a list of Unique Produt_ID for every Country.
6. One Hot Encoding of the column Country
7. Droping the sales column from test data.
8. Using RandomForestRegressor to train the model.
9. Using Hyperparameter Tuning to tune the parameters.
10. Predicting on the test dataset.
11. Submitting the model as a csv file.

The tools that were used are:-
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Anaconda
3. Pandas
4. Numpy
5. Sklearn
6. Pprint
7. RandomizedSearchCV
8. RandomForestRegressor

Correlation Matrix was plotted for feature Engineering.
